    "\n",
    "1. All statements that look like assignments are actually pattern-match statements.  For example if I state,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let [x,2,y] = [1,2,3].\n",
    "```\n",
    "that means the subject term `[1,2,3]` is matched to the pattern `[x,2,y]` and `x` and `y` are bound to the values 1 and 3, respectively.  By the way, there is nothing wrong with this statement,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let [1,2,3] = [1,2,3].\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is just another pattern match without any variable instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Asteroid allows for list slicing.  Consider the example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let a = [1,2,3].\n",
    "let b = a@1. -- access element 1\n",
    "print b.\n",

    "let b = a@[1]. -- access element 1 and return it in a list\n",
    "print b.\n",

What is perhaps new is the `head-tail` operator being used in the last `orwith` clause.  Here the variable `pivot` matches the first element of the list and the variable `rest` matches the remaining list which is the original list with its first element removed.  We can  also see that the `+` operator symbols are overloaded operators in the standard model to act as a list concatenation operators in addition to arithmetic operators. What you also will notice is that function calls do not necessarily have to involve parentheses.  Function application is also expressed by simple juxtaposition in Asteroid.  For example, if `foobar` is a function then `foobar(a)` is a function call in Asteroid but so is `foobar a`.  The latter form of function call is used in the last line of the function `qsort` below."

In our example we define our prototype object with three members: two data members, `\"name\"` and `\"tricks\"` and one function `\"add_trick\"`.  Object members are accessed in Asteroid's dictionary style syntax.

Next, we attach the `inc` function as an interpretation to the constructor `S`. We then continue to print out the value of the same term `S(S(S(0)))`. However, now `S` has an interpretation as an increment function so the value printed to the output is the value three.

    "Over the course of the previous discussions we have seen plenty of instances where we replaced one Asteroid model with another by using the appropriate `attach` and `detach` commands to manipulate the interpretation of constructors.  What is perhaps not so obvious is that we can also create overloaded models, that is, models where constructors have more than one interpretation. The example below shows a program that creates an overloaded model for the `*` operator.  Here we start by loading the standard model.  Note that in the standard model the interpretation for the `*` operator is the `mult_op` function from the `math` module.  Next we define a function that recursively computes the dot product of two vectors.  We define the function `mult_op_overloaded` that will serve as the new interpretation for the `*` operator.  This function performs one of two computations depending on the type of its arguments.  If the arguments are vectors/lists then it will compute the dot product of the two vectors otherwise it will compute the multiplication of two scalars using the `mult_op` function.  We replace the original interpretation of the `*` operator with our new overloaded interpretation by first detaching the original interpration and then attaching our new interpretation.  Observe that this new model preserves the original interpration of the `*` operator if the arguments are not vectors.  "
