    "unsigned short i = 1\n",
    "unsigned short j = 2\n",
    "unsigned short k = i + j\n",

    "j --> 00000010\n",
    "k --> 00000011\n",

    "The interesting thing about patterns is that we can manipulate them via a process called *pattern matching*.  Asteroid makes this explicit: everything (by everything we mean all expressions) in Asteroid can be interpreted as a pattern/term and therefore manipulated via pattern matching.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The values derived from patterns are usually customary *interpretations* of the patterns.  Consider the bit patterns above.  In order to derive values from these patterns we interpret the patterns as base two digits.  Other interpretations would of course be possible but perhaps not nearly as convenient.  But the fact remains that it is still just an interpretation with the possibility to change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of this kind pattern-value duality is the interpretation of \"standard\" operators.  In the above example we took it for granted that the `+` operator expresses the integer addition. But this is simply based on the *convention* that certain symbols represent certain operations applied to patterns. Again, patterns and values are attached to each other only by convention with the possibility to change this convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other programming languages Asteroid makes this connection between terms and their interpretations explicit by viewing terms as separate entities from the values that they usually represent.  As we will see, by default Asteroid still provides the \"standard\" interprestations of the conventional patterns as certain values but the connection is made explicit and can be changed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing terms and patterns as entities in their own right divorced from their default interpretation opens up the door to an interesting programming paradigm we would like to call *pattern-level* programming where the program has the ability to directly manipulate the terms representing expressions and also has control over the interpretations of those terms."
